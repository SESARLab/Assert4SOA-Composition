# Assert4SOA-Composition

Accurate and lightweight evaluation of web service security properties is a key problem, 
especially when business processes are dynamically built by composing atomic services 
provided by different suppliers at runtime. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing 
a security certification approach that virtually certifies a composite service for a set of security 
properties, starting from certificates awarded to the component services.

The software proposed resolve create a virtual certificate using the proposed solution in the following paper:
